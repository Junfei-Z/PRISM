# Few-shot Demonstration Set for Edge-side Denoising and Response Generation

Each example demonstrates how the edge model reconstructs the final response \(\hat{R}\) using:
- The original, unperturbed prompt \(P\) (available only at the edge),
- The sketch \(S\) generated by the cloud model based on a perturbed prompt \(P^*\).

## TOURISM DOMAIN

**Example 1 (Clean Sketch)**  
Prompt (P): "I plan to travel solo to Tokyo for two days; help me design my itinerary."  
Sketch (S): "Day 1: Arrival and exploration; Day 2: Cultural visit and local experience."  
Response (\(\hat{R}\)): "Sure! Here's a two-day itinerary for your Tokyo trip:  
Day 1: Morning – arrive and settle in; Afternoon – explore Shibuya and Meiji Shrine; Evening – try local ramen shops.  
Day 2: Morning – visit Asakusa and Senso-ji Temple; Afternoon – stroll in Ueno Park; Evening – Tokyo Tower view and sushi dinner."

**Example 2 (Obfuscated Cloud Sketch)**  
Prompt (P): "I plan to travel solo to Tokyo for two days; help me design my itinerary."  
Sketch (S): "Day 1: Arrival and destination orientation; Day 2: Cultural/historical visit, local dining."  
Response (\(\hat{R}\)): "Absolutely! For your Tokyo trip:  
Day 1: Check into your hotel, explore Shinjuku, visit Tokyo Metropolitan Building.  
Day 2: Start with Meiji Shrine, then visit the Edo-Tokyo Museum, and enjoy dinner in a local izakaya."

## MEDICAL DOMAIN

**Example 3 (Clean Sketch)**  
Prompt (P): "A 28-year-old female patient named Emma reports symptoms: headache and blurred vision."  
Sketch (S): "Demographics noted; Symptoms: Neurological; Plan: Imaging, specialist referral."  
Response (\(\hat{R}\)): "Emma, a 28-year-old female, presents with headache and blurred vision. Recommend neurological exam, MRI brain imaging, and referral to neurology."

**Example 4 (Obfuscated Cloud Sketch)**  
Prompt (P): "A 28-year-old female patient named Emma reports symptoms: headache and blurred vision."  
Sketch (S): "Adult patient with neurological symptoms; plan includes imaging and specialist evaluation."  
Response (\(\hat{R}\)): "Patient Emma, 28 years old, presents with headache and blurred vision. Schedule cranial MRI and consult neurology for further assessment."

## BANKING DOMAIN

**Example 5 (Clean Sketch)**  
Prompt (P): "I want to file a dispute for a $20 charge on my Chase card ending in 1234."  
Sketch (S): "Dispute initiated for transaction; card identified; review and resolution process triggered."  
Response (\(\hat{R}\)): "Understood. You've initiated a dispute for a $20 charge on your Chase card ending in 1234. We will review the transaction and notify you within 5–7 business days."

**Example 6 (Obfuscated Cloud Sketch)**  
Prompt (P): "I want to file a dispute for a $20 charge on my Chase card ending in 1234."  
Sketch (S): "Dispute filed for unknown card provider; steps include review and provisional credit."  
Response (\(\hat{R}\)): "Thanks for reporting. You've filed a dispute on a $20 charge with Chase. We've started the review and will apply provisional credit if appropriate."

## EDGE-SIDE SKETCH-TO-RESPONSE PROMPTING GUIDELINES

- Use original prompt \(P\) to recover personalized semantics lost during LDP masking.
- Use sketch \(S\) as structural guidance to organize the response flow.
- Ensure reconstructed response preserves private context from \(P\) while respecting semantic plan from \(S\).
- Do not override or contradict sketch structure unless required by critical details in \(P\).
- Favor fluent, context-specific responses (not just copying sketch items).
- Include named entities, temporal info, and personalized wording from \(P\).
